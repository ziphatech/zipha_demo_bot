  `<strong>16  What is your risk management plan for your signals?</strong>
  <blockquote>
  <i>All signal provided should be taken with PROPER RISK MANAGEMENT. Allowed risk to be used per trade is as follows;
  The maximum percentage to be risked is 2% per trade but for funded account traders it is advised to risk 0.5% or 0.25% on every signal sent.</i>
  
  0.5% risk with 4 signals daily = 2% risk daily
  0.25% risk with 4 signals daily = 1% risk daily
  1% risk with 4 signals daily = 4% risk daily [for personal account only] at your own risk 
  
  <i>Risking 2 %daily, you have 1 week to fail your challenge if all the signals provided here are all losses consistently [back to back] for 1 week.</i> 
  
  <i>Risking 1% daily, you have 2 weeks to fail your challenge if all the signals provided here are all losses consistently [back to back] for 2 week.
  Max SL will be 35pips and that will be in rare conditions so 30pips will be the commonly used SL.
  We target a (1:3 minimum) and (1:8 maximum) on every setup.
  With this, no one should complain about hitting max daily drawdown on the funded account.</i>
  </blockquote>

  NB: 
  <blockquote>
  • CMP – Current Market Price – When this is attached to any signal sent it means instant execution at the current market price.
  • LIMIT- This means placing a pending order according to the price stated.
  • B.E – This means Move Stop loss to Break Even
  • SL – Stop loss 
  • TP – Take Profit
  

  Whenever TP 1 hits you have two options
  1. Close all positions 
  2. (Take partials) Close 50% of running positions and hold till Tp2
